- I want others to see my reputation without knowing who i am https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/unirep-a-private-and-non-repudiable-reputation-system-7fb5c6478549
- I want to choose to post a request or sale anonymous or with an identity
https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/

- For instance, shopowners want to be known but they might want to keep their sales private, but still be able to prove how much of something they have sold

- and customers's purchase history needs to be hidden too
- yet a seller might only want to sell to customers who have purchased such a good before
- also you only want to sell to someone who has enough money to buy it, but the customer should not have to reveal their balance
- going in and out the market (depositing money) should also work from any address (send money to a user IN the marketplace), and exiting would also be to any address
